# üìù Milestone 2

Real estate prices, locations, and their evolution over time reveal **valuable insights** about a country's economy, wealth distribution, and urban development. Our aim is to make this accessible for the public.

## Wireframe

Our data visualization consists of 2 pages: 

- landing page,
- county-specific dashboards.

### Landing Page

Landing page focuses on simplicity and on higher level statistics. Specifically, 
we visualize **county-level yearly average transaction price**. One can use 
time-slider to see the dynamics over the years.

When hovering over the county, there will be a pop-up with basic statistics and
clicking on the county redirects to county-specific page.

### Country-Specific Dashboard

County-specific Dashboard includes:

- **line-chart**: shows the price dynamics, it also acts as the time-slider;
- **statistics**: year selected on line-chart and average salary for the county;
- **map**: split by parishes (communes), lower granularity compared to main page;
- **radar**: 
- **circular packing**:
- **treemap**:
