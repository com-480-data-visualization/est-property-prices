# üìù Milestone 2

Real estate prices, their geographical distribution, and trends over time provide **critical insights** into a country's economy, wealth distribution, and urban development. Our goal is to present these insights through **intuitive and visually compelling dashboards** that make complex data easy to understand.

## Overview of the Visualization

Our data visualization project consists of two main components:
1. **Landing Page**: Provides a high-level overview of real estate trends across counties.
2. **County-Specific Dashboards**: Offers a deep dive into detailed metrics for individual counties.

## Landing Page

The landing page is designed to be **simple yet informative**, offering users a bird's-eye view of real estate trends at the county level. Key features include:

- **County-Level Yearly Average Transaction Prices** (‚Ç¨ / m¬≤): Displayed on an interactive map.
- **Time-Slider**: Allows users to explore how prices have evolved over the years.
- **Hover and Click Interactions**:
  - Hovering over a county reveals a pop-up with summary statistics (e.g., average price, median price).
  - Clicking on a county redirects users to its corresponding county-specific dashboard.

This page serves as the entry point for users to explore temporal and spatial trends in real estate prices.

## County-Specific Dashboards

The county-specific dashboards provide a more granular view of real estate data, offering multiple visualizations and statistics. These dashboards include:

1. **Time Slider & Average Salary**: Enables to adjust the dashboard for certain year and provides average salary of the county for the year.
2. **Line Chart**: Displays price dynamics over time (‚Ç¨ / m¬≤).
3. **Detailed Map**: Focuses on parish-level (commune-level) data within the selected county.
4. **Radar Chart**: Illustrates the distribution of transactions by land type (e.g., residential, agricultural).
5. **Circular Packing Chart**: Visualizes land use categories in a hierarchical bubble format.
6. **Treemap**: Highlights non-local transactions based on buyer and seller nationalities.

Each visualization is designed to complement the others, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of real estate trends in the selected county.


## Individual Visualizations

Below is an overview of the chart ideation along with the list of relevant sources and lectures that will guide the development process. Certain foundational lectures are applicable to all visualizations, including:

- **Lecture 1**: Web Development  
- **Lectures 2 & 3**: JavaScript  
- **Lecture 6**: Perception and Color  
- **Lecture 7**: Do's and Don'ts in Design  
- **Lecture 12**: Storytelling  

These lectures provide essential principles and techniques that will be applied universally across all charts.

### Maps

Maps are central to this project, showcasing both temporal dynamics and geographical differences in transaction prices.

#### Features:
- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**:
  - Counties or parishes are color-coded based on average transaction prices.
  - A time-slider allows users to explore data for specific years.
  - Hovering highlights regions, while clicking navigates to county-specific dashboards.
  - A legend explains the color scheme with corresponding values.

- **Extras**:
  - Tooltips provide additional details (e.g., region name, average salary).
  - Play button that enables to see the progress automatically.
  - Dropdown or toggle options allow users to switch between median and average transaction prices.

#### Tools and Lectures

- [TopoJSON and GeoJSON](https://d3js.org/d3-geo)
- Lecture 8: Maps
- Lecture 5: Interactions

### Line Chart

The line chart visualizes price trends over time for the county.

#### Features:
- **MVP**:
  - A single line represents transaction price dynamics.
  - Hover effects update related charts and display tooltips with year and value (axis labels are omitted for cleaner design).

- **Extras**:
  - Users can toggle between median and average transaction prices for comparison.

#### Tools and Lectures

- [D3 line charts](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/line)
- Lecture 5: Interactions
- Lecture 11: Tabular Data

### Radar Chart

The radar chart depicts the distribution of transactions by land type (e.g., residential, commercial, agricultural).

#### Features:
- **MVP**:
  - A radar chart with clear labels explaining each axis.

- **Extras**:
  - A dropdown menu allows users to switch between different metrics (e.g., count of transactions, total area sold, total transaction value).

#### Tools and Lectures

- [D3 Spider Chart](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/spider)
- Lecture 5: Interactions
- Lecture 11: Tabular Data

### Circular Packing Chart

The circular packing chart visualizes land use categories in a hierarchical format using bubbles.

#### Features:
- **MVP**:
  - Bubbles are sized proportionally to their respective values (e.g., number of transactions or total value).

- **Extras**:
  - Interactive features such as zooming into specific categories or subcategories.
  - Tooltips display additional details about each category upon hovering.
  - A dropdown menu allows users to adjust the visualization dynamically based on predefined categories.

#### Tools and Lectures

### Treemap

The treemap highlights non-local transactions by visualizing buyer-seller relationships geographically.

#### Features:
- **MVP**:
  - Rectangles represent transaction volumes or values, categorized by buyer/seller location.

- **Extras**:
  - Filters enable users to focus on specific buyer or seller regions.
  - Color gradients indicate transaction density or value intensity within each category.
  - A dropdown menu allows users to switch between different metrics (count, total area, total value).

## Current Prototype

### To Do

- [] be more specific with chart titles and tooltip descriptions
- [] find best color scheme
- [] boxplot for tooltip of the main map?
- [] fix alignment of the year for the main page
- [] add average salary for the year
- [] add tooltip for the smaller map
- [] fix tooltip design for treemap
- [] add sequential coloring (based on values) for treemap
- [] fix title of the county formatting
