## 💡 The project

In this project, we aim to show the **property prices** evolution across **time and space** in Estonia. We believe that the trends provide **critical insights** into the country's economy, wealth distribution, and urban development. Our goal is to present these insights through **intuitive and visually compelling dashboards** that make complex data easy to understand.

### 🎯 The objectives

Our project has three key goals:  

- Make real estate data accessible to the Estonian population and empower citizens  

- Create meaningful visualizations for policymakers 

- Our methodology and visualisations could be envisoned for any other country, giving it a broad dimension
 

### 📊 The data

We selected a dataset provided by the **Estonian Government**: [Estonian Real Estate Transactions](https://www.maaamet.ee/kinnisvara/htraru/FilterUI.aspx).  
We refer you to [Milestone 1](/docs/milestone_1.md) and [Milestone 2](/docs/milestone_2.md) for more information about data quality and preprocessing. 

## ⚙️ The technical setup

The website is built using two main pages.
- the **Landing Page**: serves as the entry point for users to explore national temporal and spatial trends in real estate prices.
- the **County-specific dashboards**: provide a more granular view of real estate data, offering multiple visualizations and statistics.

We refer you to [Milestone 2](/docs/milestone_2.md) for more information about each visualisation.
